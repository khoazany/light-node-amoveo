Amoveo light node
========

This is a light node for the Amoveo cryptocurrency.

[Click this link to download a zip file of the light node](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/light-node-amoveo/archive/master.zip)

To connect to the mainnet, open src/js/wallet.html in a browser.

here is a list of full nodes that you can download headers from: https://veoscan.io/
put the IP address of a full node into the light node so it knows where to download headers from.

This is the IP of a full node that I maintain:  159.65.120.84


To connect to the testnet, you want something like this as your url: file:///home/username/light_node/src/js/wallet.html?mode=test


## OTC P2P derivatives

To test it out on the testnet, there are 3 pages to use:
This page is for sending a trade offer to another user.
file:///home/username/light_node/src/js/otc_derivatives.html?mode=test
This page is for listening to trade offers, and deciding to accept or reject them.
file:///home/username/light_node/src/js/otc_listener.html?mode=test
This page is for closing the channel once the result of the bet is recorded in the oracle.
file:///home/username/light_node/src/js/otc_finisher.html?mode=test

here is a server where I have installed the message passing software: 139.59.144.76
That is the IP you use so you can send and receive trade requests.
It loads by default when you are using the testnet.
